# Load Rasters Example

Sample client application.

Demonstrates file loading, metadata and image output.

FileReader is used to load files.
Canvas is used to display raster data.

The application intentionally does not use any frameworks. The only dependency is raster-images.
But the application is written in TypeScript.

Webpack is used for assembly. Therefore, before launching, you need to install development dependencies using the **yarn** command.

The application can be run locally with the **yarn start** command.
